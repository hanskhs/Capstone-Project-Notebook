Introduction 

Singapore is a known food paradise with influence from its multi-racialism demographic, cross-cultural historical roots, and generally, an insatiable appetite for good food. As Singapore is a small country, tourists tend to visit for a short duration, and consequentially, that means a limited number of meals for the many food gems out there. 

With Foursquare, the best food places can be shortlisted through crowdsourcing the ratings of each food place from the experience of locals and tourists combined. This Best Food Places list can then be used by a tourist to plan his itinerary for his travel in Singapore. 

Data to be used
